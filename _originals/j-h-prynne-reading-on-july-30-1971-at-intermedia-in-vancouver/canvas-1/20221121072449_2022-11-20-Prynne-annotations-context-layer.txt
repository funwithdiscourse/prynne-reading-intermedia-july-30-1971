00:04:43	00:04:49	The translation referred to was in fact made by Louise Maude. Louise and her husband Aylmer translated Tolstoy's work into English. Louise mostly translated Tolstoy’s fiction, and Aylmer mostly the philosophical writings. They settled in Essex in 1897.<br><br>Olga Kerziouk, "Tolstoy’s translator: a brief life of Aylmer Maude," <em>European Studies Blog</em> (blog), <em>British Library</em>, September 9, 2016, <a href="https://blogs.bl.uk/european/2016/09/tolstoys-translator-a-brief-life-of-aylmer-maude.html">https://blogs.bl.uk/european/2016/09/tolstoys-translator-a-brief-life-of-aylmer-maude.html</a>

In full, it reads: "Note: All the Author's royalties on this work will be devoted to the assistance of the Russian Doukhobors who have emigrated to Canada to escape the persecutions they have been undergoing at the hands of the Russian Government"

00:05:53	00:05:53	Ralph Maud taught in the English Department of Simon Fraser University, and so was presumably well located to find Popoff's book."Maud, Ralph" SFU AtoM, revised January 27, 2016, <a href="https://atom.archives.sfu.ca/maud-ralph">https://atom.archives.sfu.ca/maud-ralph</a>.<br><br>Of interest in this regard is a tiny note by Maud appearing in a journal called <em>Anarchy</em> under the heading "Further Comments on Anarchy 61: Creative Vandalism." Therein Maud describes his involvement in a "plant-in" at a piece of unused land owned by SFU, turning it into an "instant garden" in the course of an afternoon. Maud confesses to having had <em>Anarchy</em> 61 "in [his] pocket the whole time."

00:06:08	00:06:20	There is a chance that the book Prynne is talking about is in fact <em>Songs of the Doukhobors</em>. But as that collection was edited by Kenneth Peacock and issued by The National Museums of Canada, I am confident that ultimately the book being discussed here is Popoff's <em>Historical Exposition</em>. A section of <em>Songs of the Doukhobors</em> is <a href="https://collections.museedelhistoire.ca/public/objects/common/webmedia.php?irn=5192506">available onine</a> (this link triggers a download.)

00:06:21	00:06:31	The "stole[n]" line comes from a poem called "In His Youth He Walked Much" on page 30 of Popoff's book. In fact the lines in "Royal Fern" are slightly modified versions of phrases appearing in the Doukhobor poem, and that poem seems to provide "Royal Fern" with some of its vocabularly too.
