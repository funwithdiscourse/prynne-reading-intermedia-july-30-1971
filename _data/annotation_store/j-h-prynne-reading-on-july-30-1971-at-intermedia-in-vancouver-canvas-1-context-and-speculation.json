The complicated status of quotation and reference in Prynne's poems is dramatised throughout this recording. Earlier it has been seen that Prynne has freely borrowed from sources, and (to an extent) integreated them into his thinking such that he no longer recognises them as foreign (but, of course, he may simply have forgotten; even then, \"simply\" obscures somewhat the intricacies of remembering and forgetting.) Later in the recording, during prefatory remarks to his reading of \"A Stone Called Nothing\" another source of silent quotation is explained, but simultaneously dismissed as not necessary knowledge for engaging with the poem.

        "value": "The silence, and then applause following this poem is, to my ears, the most striking moment in the recording. Yet, I am not sure what exactly prompts it. It could be that it has something in common with a reading Prynne gave of <em>Kazoo Dreamboats</em>, described by Luke Roberts (I quote at length):<br><br>\" I remember the night he read from it in an occupied lecture hall in Cambridge during the widespread student protests again tuition fees in 2010-11. The whole thing was amazingly weird, an audience equally puzzled and rapt, the atmosphere crackling with energy. Prynne was an enthusiastic supporter of the student occupiers, going out to fetch ice cream and snacks, writing letters against both the university bureaucracy and the government spokespersons for the free market in higher education. The context for the reading was appropriate. And I remember reading the poem avidly during that period and feeling—a feeling I think I shared with others—that I understood it completely. There was no need to itemise the discourses or to look anything up in the dictionary. The poem felt generous, optimistic, and open.\"<br><br>and<br><br>\"But <em>Kazoo Dreamboats</em>, at that time, was different. At the risk of overreaching: in the context of high social disturbance on a local, national, and international scale, the poem skipped right over the problem of comprehension and explication: it just made sense. And the sense it made was reliant, absolutely, on what gets called in critical shorthand <em>the social and historical context</em>. The poem was equal to the turbulence of the time, participating joyfully in the rupture of normal life.\"<br><br>If this were so, it would seem to require also the work of \"mental ears,\" among other techniques, to reconstruct the force of this moment. A more mundane explanation, however, may be that the audience was, to loosely use a term from Erving Goffman, \"keyed\" to the significance of the poem by Prynne's introductory remarks, which introduce a possible whisper of some of the geopolitical tensions of the moment. It is worth noting too, that the Royal Canadian Air Force (now the Canadian Armed Forces) fleet contained a modified version of F-104 Starfighter at the time of this recording. Looked at this way the poem indexes a more \"local\" politics, rather than the distant history of some of the other poems in this reading, and so is perhaps more readily apprehended, or felt, by the audience. At the same time though, beneath even this supposition is some version of what Roberts describes. If Prynne's remarks do \"key\" the poem that process still involves an interaction with an ambient and ephemeral \"mood\" that would be difficult to reconstruct in the present.<br><br>Luke Roberts, “By Law in Sound: J.
