## Prefatory Notes

1. “It's from this distinction that my own lack of interest in the performance of poems in their author's own voice takes its origin; the specific occasional delivery is no more than an accidentalism of sound and behavior, since it is the language of the text that has and produces voice, and not the mere vocal equipment and habits of a speaker. An author-speaker of text in self-performance may seem to be a special case, in that features of such delivery can seem to be communicating an authentic textual inwardness, from the stance of an authorized knowledge and self-interpretation. But such semblance is really delusional; this is to undo the work of mental ears, by a kind of primitive literal-mindedness: “Look, the poet is wearing red socks! Now at last we understand everything!””
2. The annotations tend towards two poles, “context” and "speculation,” although there is some overlap. The labels are perhaps self-explanatory, but “context” provides citations and the like, in order to enrich the recording, while “speculation” asks questions arising from the combination of the recording and contextual information.
