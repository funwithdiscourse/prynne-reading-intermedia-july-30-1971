### Prefatory notes

* The recording of this reading was made by Fred Wah on a 5" reel-to-reel, at an old Church that [Intermedia](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermedia_(artists%27_association) "Intermedia page on Wikipedia") used occasionally, and the reading was scheduled to start at 8PM.[^1] It seems worthwhile to keep in mind that the recording you are listening to was made on a summer's night.
* Prynne has a strongly stated (if shifting) position towards giving readings of his own poetry. One expression of this position can be found in an essay, originally from a lecture, appearing in *The Chicago Review*: 

> “It's from this distinction [between phonology and phonetics] that my own lack of interest in the performance of poems in their author's own voice takes its origin; the specific occasional delivery is no more than an accidentalism of sound and behavior, since it is the language of the text that has and produces voice, and not the mere vocal equipment and habits of a speaker. An author-speaker of text in self-performance may seem to be a special case, in that features of such delivery can seem to be communicating an authentic textual inwardness, from the stance of an authorized knowledge and self-interpretation. But such semblance is really delusional; this is to undo the work of mental ears, by a kind of primitive literal-mindedness: “Look, the poet is wearing red socks! Now at last we understand everything!”” [^2]

* Partially in light of this position, I have focused these annotations more on those parts of the recording that do not contain Prynne’s readings of his poems. At the same time, the choice is motivated by an interest in the context, the remarks Prynne makes, his interactions with the audience, as well as the “activity” of the room itself.
* However, this extract includes reference to a concept, “mental ears,” which in fact the essay is named for. It is a complex concept, and one that Prynne introduces experimentally. As such, I will only highlight one aspect of it here:

> “Mental ears also permit reconstruction of raw phonetic data, in particular across precedent historical eras, so that the alert poet as reader can "tune in" to earlier schedules of poetic composition: the percipient self re-locates so as to occupy a prior station already inflected by knowledge of successor historical conditions” [^3]

* Reductively, mental ears describes a way for poets to engage with poetry and poetic language. And so, while the quote above does not explicitly cover listening to recordings in the way that I have done here, I think it offers a very suggestive to try and engage with them all the same: to “reconstruct” what is heard as it may have been heard at first utterance.
* The annotations tend towards two poles, “context” and "speculation,” although there is some overlap. The labels are perhaps self-explanatory, but “context” provides citations and the like, in order to enrich the recording, while “speculation” asks questions arising from the combination of the recording and contextual information.
* References made to the text of particular poems in this recording are to their appearance in J. H. Prynne, *Poems* (Hexham, Northumberland: Bloodaxe Books, 2015).
